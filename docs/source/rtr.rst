NOTE: you can add multiple files for co-hosting feature.  Repeat steps 2 & 3 with a second file and third file.

REMINDER: the exported data file cannot be modified (cannot be opened and saved as excel). The file will show as excel which is fine and should only be copied and pasted to desired folder on your computer. Everyone has a different “download folder”.  Find that folder, copy the file and paste to desired folder for the analysis.  The file will have the following name

OfficialRegistration List_DD-MM-YYYY.xls

If you need to start over you can reset the RTR data, click Reset button and repeat steps 2 & 3.
