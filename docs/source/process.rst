Analyzer / Report Settings Tab
==============================

1.	Select which status (of registration) you want to use. (note that Swim Ontario will use status "Active" when determining sanction tier). Reminder: 

    a.	Invoice Pending status – the official has not yet been put on an invoice.  The COA would need to generate an invoice to begin the registration process.
    b.	PSO Pending status – the club has not yet paid the generated invoice that this official is on.  The COA would need to arrange for payment by the club to Swim Ontario.
    c.	Account Pending – the club has started the registration and paid the invoice - the official has not yet completed their registration and consent forms.  The official needs to login and complete the steps.  
    d.	Active – fully registered official

2.	 The analyzer also analyses the export for certain errors and provides warnings.  You can turn these off or keep them for the report.


3.	The analyzer can also include all affiliated officials with your club.  You can select to use them or not.  

    a.	Affiliated officials must be listed with your club in the RTR for this to work.
